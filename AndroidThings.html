    Overview

  <div>
The main idea for the project Ive tried to understand how the pins of the raspberry pi board worked and try to play a little with them,
from obvious reasons I was not having access to other sensors, only to a resitor,
few leds and a raspberry pi board. So basically Ive implemented 3 options in the main application
the first one starts blinking the led for about 10 seconds the second one turns on the led and the third one it will turn the led off.
